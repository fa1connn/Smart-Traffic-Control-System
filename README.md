# Smart Traffic Control System

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for the **Smart Traffic Control System**, a simulation software designed to optimize urban traffic flow and minimize vehicle waiting times at intersections.

Developed as part of the Computer Engineering curriculum at **Sivas University of Science and Technology (SBTÜ)**, this project utilizes algorithmic approaches to simulate and manage traffic light timings dynamically.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Optimization:** Reducing average wait times for vehicles at intersections effectively.
* **Simulation:** Visualizing traffic flow and congestion scenarios using a graphical user interface.
* **Algorithmic Logic:** Implementing logic for automated traffic signal control based on density or timer-based systems.
* **Sustainability:** Aiming to reduce carbon emissions by minimizing idle times in traffic.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Programming Language:** Java
* **GUI Framework:** Java Swing / AWT
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code / IntelliJ IDEA
